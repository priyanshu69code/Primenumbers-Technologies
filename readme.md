# HPRERA Project Scraper

This project is a web scraper that extracts information about registered projects from the Himachal Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HPRERA) website.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd [your-project-directory]
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using Pipenv:
   ```
   pipenv install
   ```

5. Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and in your system PATH.

## Running the Scraper

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
   - For venv:
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Pipenv: `pipenv shell`

2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python [your-main-script-name].py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `[your-main-script-name].py`: The main script containing the scraper logic.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python package dependencies.
- `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`: Pipenv dependency files (if using Pipenv).

## Functionality

The scraper performs the following actions:
1. Opens the HPRERA website in headless Chrome browser.
2. Clicks through the "Registered Projects" tabs.
3. Extracts information including Name, GSTIN, PAN, and Permanent Address for each project.
4. Saves the extracted data to a CSV file named `project_data.csv`.

## Output

The scraper generates a CSV file named `project_data.csv` with the following columns:
- Name
- GSTIN
- PAN
- Permanent Address

## Notes

- The script includes a 60-second wait time after loading the page to allow for dynamic content to load. This may need adjustment based on network conditions.
- Each tab click is followed by a 15-second wait. Adjust this if needed based on page load times.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with ChromeDriver, ensure it's properly installed and its version matches your Chrome browser version.
- Adjust the wait times in the script if the page is not loading completely before scraping attempts.

## Disclaimer

Ensure you have permission to scrape the target website and that you comply with their terms of service and robots.txt file.
